# AWS IAM

AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that helps you manage access to your AWS resources. It's like a security system for your AWS account.

IAM allows you to create and manage users, groups, and roles. Users represent individual people or entities who need access to your AWS resources. Groups are collections of users with similar access requirements, making it easier to manage permissions. Roles are used to grant temporary access to external entities or services.

IAM follows the principle of least privilege, meaning users and entities are given only the necessary permissions required for their tasks, minimizing potential security risks. IAM also provides features like multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security and an audit trail to track user activity and changes to permissions.

By using AWS IAM, you can effectively manage and secure access to your AWS resources, ensuring that only authorized individuals have appropriate permissions and actions are logged for accountability and compliance purposes.

Overall, IAM is an essential component of AWS security, providing granular control over access to your AWS account and resources, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and helping maintain a secure environment.

# AWS EC2

What is EC2, and why is it important?

- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
- Access reliable, scalable infrastructure on demand. Scale capacity within minutes with SLA commitment of 99.99% availability.
- Provide secure compute for your applications. Security is built into the foundation of Amazon EC2 with the AWS Nitro System.
- Optimize performance and cost with flexible options like AWS Graviton-based instances, Amazon EC2 Spot instances, and AWS Savings Plans.
